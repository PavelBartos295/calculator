"""
So at the begining, I have to download git. If its ok, i can check it with this comand : git --version
Than I have to locate, where i wanted to have all my local files. : cd/path/to/my/project
So I set the path and now I have to make git project folder: git init
And if its right i cant check it with : ls-a (at the int, there should be .git)
Than I have to stage all my files: git add .
If i wanted to push my code, than i have to commit them: git commit -m
This should be everything

There is also a few usefull commands i can use:
git clone -> i will steel repository to my local 
git branch "branch name" -> this is how to make new branch
git checkout "branch name" -> switch to the new branch
